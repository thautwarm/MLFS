=========================

*The page is under construction*

Aiming at expressing all programming abstractions in one language.

.. role:: wip

Features(gray section means the feature is WIP):

1. Type safety and implicit type inference
2. Type level programming to express advanced constraints

3. Supreme features from functional programming world:

   1. Implicit arguments, type classes, higher kinded typed, higher rank types.

   2. :wip:`Generalised algebraic data types` and :wip:`extensible and first-class pattern matching`.

4. :wip:`Object-oriented and inheritances, via type classes`
5. Type driven development via type holes and wildcard types
6. Agnostic code generation targets
7. :wip:`Type-safe and scope-safe meta-programming and staging programming`

Besides, U shall be efficient in coding and execution.
